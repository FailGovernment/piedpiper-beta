Bootstrap based HTML/CSS Pied Piper Interface

Based on the dropbox [screenshot tweet](https://twitter.com/Dropbox/status/739645743862931456)

Some parts aren't quite finished and it's definitely not mobile friendly (probably not even non-retina) but it's beta and
Reid Hoffman once said; 'If you are not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you've launched too late.'

###### Todo:
Maybe add some cool/fun frontend framework like VueJS to actually make parts of the interface functional and oh yeah 
how about actually finishing the account css/html
